<h2>About My Paintings</h2>

<p>My parents always said I was “born too late” because I have always had a romantic 
fascination for certain eras, especially the 1940’s. I love the Big Band sound 
and the music of Gershwin. I think the fashions of the 40’s were the most stylish 
and well designed.</p>

<p>Many of my earliest childhood memories are of cross-country car trips out west 
in the 1960’s. I remember the faded Burma Shave signs along the way and there 
would be at least one prolonged stay at a service station because of a flat tire 
or over heated engine. There we would get our bottles of pop from the chest type 
machines where you had to fish your bottle out of a maze like contraption. We 
ate at cafes and stayed at motor inns or motels with their neon signs blinking 
in the dark.</p>

<p>These are the subjects I enjoy painting and places with character are getting 
very scarce. There is the joke in my family that everything I paint closes or 
gets torn down. I decided to avoid being a menace to local businesses and research 
the file photos at the Minnesota History Center and the Hennepin County Historical 
Society to find new subject matter for my next set of paintings.</p>

<p>I started my search with Lake Street in Minneapolis and the Midway and Rondo areas 
of Saint Paul from 1940 to 1960. The 40’s represent a still vital time and the 60’s 
seem to be the beginning of “urban renewal.”</p>

<p>It was exciting looking through the photos and finding some great subjects to paint. 
I’m sad for what we have lost, but amused that some of the elements that were destroyed 
by urban renewal are back in vogue. How many neighborhoods are seeking grants for new 
“old” pedestrian lighting?</p>

<p>I enjoyed the process of looking at the black and white photos and bringing them 
to life with color using oil paints. I had to do additional research for the colors 
of the signs that has been very interesting.</p>

<p>I try to capture realistic representations from the perspective of a passing car or 
a person walking by so the viewer feels like they could walk into the painting. 
Ideally, the image brings back memories for the viewer of the place in the painting 
or of similar places that the viewer is familiar with. When I exhibit the paintings, 
it’s especially satisfying to have someone come up and tell me a story about one of 
the places I have painted.</p>

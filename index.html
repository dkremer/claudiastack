<h2>About My Paintings</h2>
<p>I search for ordinary places that are unique and full of character;
    places that make a community or neighborhood special and remind me of
    times gone by. Sometimes I’m lucky and find existing places while on
    road trips. Other times I search for subjects in the Minnesota History
    Center archives. </p>
<p>I try to capture realistic representations from the perspective of a
    passing car or a person walking by so the viewer feels like they could
    walk into the painting. Ideally, the image brings back memories for the
    viewer of the place in the painting or of similar places that the viewer
    is familiar with. When I exhibit the paintings, it’s especially
    satisfying to have someone come up and tell me a story about one of the
    places I have painted.</p>

		<h2>About My Paintings</h2>
		<p>My parents always said I was “born too late” because I have always 
		had a romantic fascination for certain eras, especially the 1940’s. I 
		love the Big Band sound and the music of Gershwin. I think the fashions 
		of the 40’s were the most stylish and well designed.</p>
		<p>Many of my earliest childhood memories are of cross-country car trips 
		out west in the 1960’s. I remember the faded Burma Shave signs along the 
		way and there would be at least one prolonged stay at a service station 
		because of a flat tire or over heated engine. There we would get our 
		bottles of pop from the chest type machines where you had to fish your 
		bottle out of a maze like contraption. We ate at cafes and stayed at 
		motor inns or motels with their neon signs blinking in the dark.</p>
		<p>These are the subjects I enjoy painting and places with character are 
		getting very scarce. There is the joke in my family that everything I 
		paint closes or gets torn down. I decided to avoid being a menace to 
		local businesses and research the file photos at the Minnesota History 
		Center and the Hennepin County Historical Society to find new subject 
		matter for my next set of paintings.</p>
		<p>I started my search with Lake Street in Minneapolis and the Midway 
		and Rondo areas of Saint Paul from 1940 to 1960. The 40’s represent a 
		still vital time and the 60’s seem to be the beginning of “urban 
		renewal.”</p>
		<p>It was exciting looking through the photos and finding some great 
		subjects to paint. I’m sad for what we have lost, but amused that some 
		of the elements that were destroyed by urban renewal are back in vogue. 
		How many neighborhoods are seeking grants for new “old” pedestrian 
		lighting?</p>
		<p>I enjoyed the process of looking at the black and white photos and 
		bringing them to life with color using oil paints. I had to do 
		additional research for the colors of the signs that has been very 
		interesting.</p>
		<p>I try to capture realistic representations from the perspective of a 
		passing car or a person walking by so the viewer feels like they could 
		walk into the painting. Ideally, the image brings back memories for the 
		viewer of the place in the painting or of similar places that the viewer 
		is familiar with. When I exhibit the paintings, it’s especially 
		satisfying to have someone come up and tell me a story about one of the 
		places I have painted.</p>
